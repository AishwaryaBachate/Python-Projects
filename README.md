**Data Sources**

Customers Dataset: Customer IDs, demographic details.

Transactions Dataset: Transaction details, product purchases, quantities, and amounts.

Product Hierarchy Dataset: Product categories and subcategories.

**Data Processing**

Merging Data: The three datasets were merged to form a comprehensive dataset, ensuring all customers with transactions were included.

Data Cleaning: Missing values were addressed, and dates were converted to datetime format for accurate time-based analysis.

Key Metrics Generated: top-selling products and more.

**Key Insights**

A small group of high-value customers drives most revenue, while many are one-time buyers with low retention.

Books and Electronics dominate sales, while certain categories underperform. Popular products show consistent demand across seasons.

e-Shop store type sells the maximum products by value and by quantity.

**Recommendations**

Boost Customer Retention:
Implement loyalty programs and personalized offers to turn one-time buyers into repeat customers and enhance lifetime value.

Leverage Top-Selling Categories:
Focus on expanding and promoting high-performing categories like electronics and home goods to drive revenue growth.

Capitalize on Seasonal Peaks:
Plan inventory and marketing efforts around holiday peaks to maximize sales, especially for top products.

Encourage Larger Purchases:
Use cross-selling and bundling strategies to increase the average transaction size, particularly during weekends and sales events.

Reassess Underperforming Categories:
Optimize marketing or phase out low-performing product lines to focus on more profitable segments.
